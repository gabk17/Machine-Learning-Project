# Machine-Learning-Project
This is a cumulative Capstone Project: it relies on the usage of the "Meta Prophet
The Facebook or Meta "Prophet" is a Tool for producing high-quality forecasts for time series data that has multiple seasonality with linear or non-linear growth.

You are asked to download the python version, train yourself on it, and use it to predict the EDL cutoffs in Lebanon, which is something very difficult to do obviously. 

Every group should compile an official 20 pages presentation to be delivered during the last week of the semester. 

My main idea was to sue a .csv file generated by EDL (electricity du Liban), but it was so messy that I don't think that it will generate a clear juice to use!

So you are asked to use any .csv file (related to electricity cutoffs or fluctuations) you may find on GitHub and use it to forecast.
